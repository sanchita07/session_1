```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```
Download sleep study data

```{r}
library(readr)
sleep <-read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/lme4/sleepstudy.csv") # no spaces
head(sleep)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
